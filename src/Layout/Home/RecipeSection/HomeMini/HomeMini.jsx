        cuisine also makes use of various seasonal fruits, vegetables, and
        herbs, such as jackfruit, mango, water spinach, eggplant, and mustard
        greens. <br /> <br /> Some of the most famous Bangladeshi dishes include
        biryani, a fragrant rice dish cooked with meat or vegetables, and dal, a
